# Quantum Data Encoding Methods – QML Series
This notebook explores various quantum data encoding methods: basis, amplitude, angle, and arbitrary encoding used in Quantum Machine Learning. It demonstrates how classical data is transformed into quantum states using Qiskit circuits.

- **Basis Encoding**
- **Amplitude Encoding**
- **Angle Encoding**
- **Arbitrary State Encoding**

## 🔍 Why Encoding?

Before quantum models can process classical data, it must be encoded into a quantum state. This notebook illustrates **how to translate classical data** into quantum states using various encoding strategies, forming the core of many QML algorithms.

## 📘 What’s Inside

| Encoding Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Basis Encoding** | Maps binary strings to computational basis states |
| **Amplitude Encoding** | Encodes normalized vector values into amplitudes of a quantum state |
| **Angle Encoding** | Encodes data into rotation angles of quantum gates (Rx, Ry, Rz) |
| **Arbitrary Encoding** | Directly defines any custom quantum state vector (when allowed) |
